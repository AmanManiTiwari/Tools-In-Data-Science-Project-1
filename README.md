Scraping Data: I used the GitHub API to scrape all users in London with over 500 followers, then fetched up to 500 repositories for each user.
Interesting Finding: Most users in London with over 500 followers work in tech and have repositories primarily in Python and JavaScript.
Recommendation: Developers should focus on contributing to repositories with high stargazers in popular languages like Python and JavaScript to increase visibility.
